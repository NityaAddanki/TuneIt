# TuneIt 🎵

**TuneIt** is a cross-platform music recommendation app built with **React Native and TypeScript**. It provides personalized music suggestions based on user mood, with a functional and interactive UI.

> ⚠️ **Work in progress:** The front-end UI is mostly complete. Data storage and persistence are still under development.

## Features

- Functional and intuitive UI for mood-based music recommendations
- Cross-platform support: Android and iOS (via Expo)
- Real-time updates for selected music preferences
- Modular architecture for easy future expansion

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the app
```bash
npx expo start
```

You can open the app in:

- Web (type w after running npx expo start)
- Development build
- Android emulator
- iOS simulator
- Expo Go (limited sandbox)

### 3. Start developing

- Edit files inside the `app` directory
- The project uses file-based routing for organization

### 4. Reset project (optional)

If you want a fresh start:
```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves the starter code to `app-example` and creates a blank `app` directory.
